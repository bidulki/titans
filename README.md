# titans
Unofficial pytorch implementation of [Titans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663) 
The purpose of this repository is to implement the Titans paper as faithfully as possible, 
train on the same [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu), and verify whether similar results can be reproduced.

# TODO

- [X] Neural Memory
- [X] MAC
- [ ] MAG
- [ ] MAL
- [ ] LMM
- [ ] train.py
- [ ] Paralleize training process
- [ ] make alpha, theata, eta learnable parameter
